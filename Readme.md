# 🌙 Stay

> **Stay** — because one more day can change everything.

**Stay** is a safe digital space built to support people struggling with mental health challenges — depression, suicidal thoughts, or addiction.  
It’s for anyone who feels lost and just needs one simple reminder: *you are not alone.*

## 💡 About the Project

**Stay** is more than just an app — it’s a message.

A message that says *“Don’t give up yet.”*  
Through gentle interaction, positive reinforcement, and access to real human connection, **Stay** helps users take small steps toward healing and hope.

This project began with a simple idea:
> “What if a single message, a small chat, or a voice of understanding could help someone decide to stay?”
